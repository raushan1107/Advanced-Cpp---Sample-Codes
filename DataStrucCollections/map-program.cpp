What is a map in C++?
A map in C++ is an associative container that stores elements in key-value pairs.
Each key is unique, and it is used to access the corresponding value.

How does a map work?
Internally, a map is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree (like a Red-Black tree).
When you insert a key-value pair into the map, the map organizes the elements based on the keys,
allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

When to use a map?
Use a map when you need to associate unique keys with specific values and require fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
