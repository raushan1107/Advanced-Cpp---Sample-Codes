// include<bits/stdc++.h> vs include<vector>
// #include<bits/stdc++.h> is a non-standard header file that includes all standard library headers.
// It is often used in competitive programming for convenience, but it can lead to longer compilation times
// and is not portable across different compilers.
// On the other hand, #include<vector> specifically includes only the vector header from the standard library.
// This is the preferred approach in production code as it improves compilation time and code clarity.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include<bits/stdc++.h> // Not recommended for production code

    // why do we need to reserve vector? 
    // Because reserving space in a vector helps to minimize the number of reallocations
    // that occur when new elements are added. Each reallocation involves allocating new memory,
    // copying existing elements to the new memory, and freeing the old memory, which can be expensive.
    // By reserving enough space in advance, we can improve performance when we know the number of elements
    // that will be added to the vector.
    // Real world example: Preallocating memory for a dynamic array that will store user inputs.
    // If you expect to store 1000 integers based on user input, reserving space for 1000 elements
    // in advance can help avoid multiple reallocations as the user adds integers to the array.
