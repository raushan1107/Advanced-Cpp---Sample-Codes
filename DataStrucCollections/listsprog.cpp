// splice explanation:
// The splice operation transfers elements from one list to another.
// In this example, we transfer all elements from the fruits list to the moreFruits list except the first one.
// We use the splice method of the moreFruits list, specifying the position to insert (the beginning of moreFruits),
// the source list (fruits), and the range of elements to transfer (from the second element to the end).
// This operation is efficient because it does not involve copying or moving the elements;
// it simply adjusts the internal pointers of the lists.
// After the splice operation, the moreFruits list contains "Banana" and "Cherry",
// while the fruits list retains only "Apple".
