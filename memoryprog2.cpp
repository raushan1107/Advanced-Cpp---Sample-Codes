// thread_local int threadVar = 0; // each thread has its own copy

// In a multi-threaded program, modifying threadVar in one thread does not affect its value in another thread,

    // Placement new example: It allows constructing an object in a pre-allocated memory buffer rather than allocating new memory on the heap.
    char buffer[sizeof(S)];
    S* s = new (buffer) S(42); // placement-new constructs in buffer (stack memory)
    // Means instead of allocating new memory on heap, it uses the provided buffer to construct the object.

    // Real world use cases of placement new?
    // Placement new is often used in performance-critical applications where memory allocation overhead needs to be minimized
    // It is also used in custom memory management systems, such as memory pools or arenas,
    // where objects are constructed in pre-allocated memory blocks.
