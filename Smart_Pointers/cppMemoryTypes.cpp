// What is memory leaks: Memory leaks occur when a program allocates 
//memory but fails to release it back to the system after it's no longer needed. 
//This can lead to increased memory usage over time and may eventually cause the 
//program to run out of memory.

// How to verify memory types?
    // We can use tools like Valgrind (on Linux) or Visual Studio's built
    // in diagnostic tools (on Windows) to monitor memory usage and detect leaks.
    // These tools can help identify memory that was allocated but not properly deallocated.

    // When to use which memory type?
    // - Use stack memory for local variables with a short lifetime.
    // - Use heap memory for objects that need to persist beyond the scope of a function or have a large size.
    // - Use static/global memory for variables that need to maintain state across function calls or throughout
    // the program's lifetime.
    // - Code/Text segment is managed by the operating system and is not directly controlled by the programmer.
    // Proper memory management is crucial for efficient and reliable C++ programs.


    // Language terms:
    // 1. Memory Allocation: The process of reserving a block of memory for use by a program.
    // 2. Memory Deallocation: The process of releasing previously allocated memory back to the
    // system.
    // 3. Dangling Pointer: A pointer that points to a memory location that has
    // already been deallocated.
    // 4. Fragmentation: The condition where free memory is divided into small,
    // non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous memory blocks.
    // 5. Garbage Collection: An automatic memory management technique where the system
    // periodically identifies and frees memory that is no longer in use by the program.
    // C++ does not have built-in garbage collection, but smart pointers can help manage memory automatically.
    // 6. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): A programming idiom where resource allocation
    // is tied to the lifetime of objects. Resources are acquired during object creation and released during
    // object destruction.

    // what is storage duration in C++?
    // Storage duration determines the lifetime of a variable and when its memory is allocated and deallocated.
    // There are four types of storage duration in C++:
    // 1. Automatic Storage Duration: Variables are automatically allocated and deallocated when they go out of scope.
    // 2. Static Storage Duration: Variables are allocated when the program starts and deallocated when it ends.
    // 3. Dynamic Storage Duration: Variables are allocated and deallocated manually using new and delete.
    // 4. Thread Storage Duration: Variables are allocated for the lifetime of a thread.

    // Safety and Common bugs:
    // 1. Memory Leaks: Failing to deallocate memory can lead to increased
    // memory usage over time.
    // 2. Dangling Pointers: Accessing memory that has already been deallocated
    // can lead to undefined behavior.
    // 3. Buffer Overflows: Writing beyond the allocated memory can corrupt data
    // and lead to security vulnerabilities.
    // 4. Double Free: Deallocating the same memory block more than once can
    // lead to undefined behavior. But how it happens?
    // It happens when a program calls delete or free on the same memory address multiple times.
    // or shared pointers going out of scope together.
    // This can corrupt the memory management data structures, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
    // 5. Use After Free: Accessing memory after it has been deallocated can
    // lead to undefined behavior.
    // To avoid these issues, use smart pointers, follow RAII principles, and utilize
    // memory profiling tools to monitor and manage memory effectively.

// Memory types:
// 1. Stack Memory: Used for static memory allocation. Variables are automatically allocated and deallocated when they go out of scope.
// 2. Heap Memory: Used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory is manually allocated and de
// allocated using new and delete keywords.
// 3. Static/Global Memory: Used for global and static variables. Memory is allocated
// when the program starts and deallocated when the program ends.
// 4. Code/Text Segment: Contains the compiled program code. This memory is read-only and shared among processes.
// How to manage memory effectively in C++:
// 1. Use smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) to manage dynamic memory automatically
// 2. Avoid memory leaks by ensuring every new has a corresponding delete
// 3. Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles to tie resource management to
// object lifetime
// 4. Regularly profile and monitor memory usage to identify potential leaks or inefficiencies


//& vs && in C++
// & is the address-of operator, used to get the memory address of a variable.
// && is the rvalue reference operator, used to bind to temporary objects (rvalues) for move semantics.
