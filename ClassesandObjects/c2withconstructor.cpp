    // Copy Constructor (optional)
    /* 
    Copy constructor is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. It is called when an object is passed by value, returned from a function, or explicitly copied.
    It is defined with a single parameter that is a reference to an object of the same class.
    In real-world scenarios, if you don't define a copy constructor, the compiler provides a default one that performs a shallow copy. However, if your class manages resources like dynamic memory, file handles, etc., you should define your own copy constructor to ensure a deep copy and proper resource management.
    Analogy: Think of a copy constructor like making a photocopy of a document. The photocopy is a separate entity that contains the same information as the original document, but changes made to the photocopy do not affect the original document.
