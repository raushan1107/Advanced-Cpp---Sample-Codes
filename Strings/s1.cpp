// String manipulation in C++ using C++17 standard
// This program demonstrates various string operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, and searching.
// What is a string? In C++, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. The C++ Standard Library provides the `std::string` class, which offers a convenient way to work with strings, including dynamic sizing and various member functions for manipulation.
// Analogy: Think of a string as a necklace made up of individual beads (characters). You can add more beads, remove some, or rearrange them to create different patterns (manipulate the string).

    // Concatenation
    string str3 = str1 + str2;
    cout << "Concatenated String: " << str3 << endl;

    // Substring extraction
    string subStr = str3.substr(7, 5); // Extract "World"
    cout << "Extracted Substring: " << subStr << endl;

    // Searching for a substring
