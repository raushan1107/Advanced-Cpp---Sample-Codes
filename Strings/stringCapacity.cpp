// Where do we use string capacity functions?
// 1. Performance Optimization: Pre-allocating memory to avoid multiple reallocations.
// 2. Memory Management: Controlling memory usage in applications with large strings.
// 3. Dynamic String Handling: Efficiently managing strings that change size frequently.
// 4. Game Development: Managing in-game text and dialogues efficiently.
// 5. Real-time Systems: Ensuring predictable memory usage and performance.
// 6. Text Processing Applications: Handling large volumes of text data efficiently.
// 7. Network Programming: Managing buffers for incoming and outgoing data.
// 8. Embedded Systems: Optimizing memory usage in resource-constrained environments.
// 9. Database Systems: Efficiently managing string data in databases.
// 10. User Interface Development: Handling dynamic text in UI elements efficiently.
// This code demonstrates the use of string capacity functions in C++.
// It shows how to check and manipulate the capacity of strings for performance optimization and memory management.

// How it works?
// 1. The program starts by including the necessary headers and using the std namespace.
// 2. It initializes a string with "Hello, World!" and prints its size, length, capacity, and max size.
// 3. It then reserves a capacity of 500 for the string and prints the updated properties.
// 4. An empty string is created, and its initial capacity is printed.
// 5. The program appends "C++ Programming" to the string and prints the new capacity.
// 6. It reserves a capacity of 1000 and appends 800 'a' characters, printing the capacity after each operation.
// 7. The shrink_to_fit function is called to reduce the capacity to fit the current
//    size, and the new capacity is printed.
// 8. The string is cleared, and the capacity is printed again.
// 9. Finally, the program prints the final state of the string and returns 0 to indicate successful execution. size, and the new capacity is printed.
// 8. The string is cleared, and the capacity is printed again.
// 9. Finally, the program prints the final state of the string and returns 0 to indicate successful execution. size, and the new capacity is printed.
